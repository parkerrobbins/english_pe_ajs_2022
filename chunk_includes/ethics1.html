<h3>Consent for Participation in Psycholinguistic Research</h2>

<p><strong>Description of Project: </strong>You are invited to participate in a linguistics experiment conducted at the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC). This form provides information about the experimentâ€™s purpose, procedures, risks and benefits to help you make an informed judgment about whether to participate. Once you understand the procedures, you will be asked if you wish to participate; if so, you will be asked to click a checkbox before proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of research: </strong>The principal researcher is Dave Kush, a faculty member in the Department of Language Studies at UTSC. The general purpose of the experiment is to understand how humans comprehend language.</p>

<p><strong>Description of the Procedure: </strong>In this experiment, you will read sentences and answer questions about those sentences. Sentences will be presented on your computer screen. You will be asked to either respond via a keyboard button press or a mouse click.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and Inconveniences: </strong>There are no known physical or psychological risks or discomforts associated with participation.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits: </strong>You will not benefit directly from this research apart from receiving course credit for your participation. The scientific community will potentially benefit from your participation if the experiment results in a publication that informs models of sentence comprehension.</p>

<p><strong>Compensation: </strong>You will receive 1 hour of credit towards your course requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality: </strong>We collect basic demographic information about participants (age, gender, and language background), but nothing that could identify you as an individual. All data will be kept completely confidential. No individual data will be made public in any presentations or publications. Results will be stored in an anonymized electronic data file in accordance with the norms of Participant Data Confidentiality at the University of Toronto. The researcher will have access to this data file. The Human Research Ethics Unit may also have confidential access to data files to help ensure participant protection procedures are followed.
